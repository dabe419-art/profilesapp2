/**
 * Custom-resource Lambda that writes key/value entries into a CloudFront
 * KeyValueStore (KVS) at deploy time.
 *
 * Why a custom resource: CDK's `KeyValueStore` + `ImportSource` only seed the
 * store at CREATE time. A redeploy that changes the route table or the active
 * `buildId` needs a LIVE update of an existing store — which the CloudFormation
 * resource doesn't do. We perform it via the `cloudfront-keyvaluestore`
 * data-plane API (DescribeKeyValueStore → get ETag → UpdateKeys), the same
 * mechanism SST's `KvKeys` provider uses.
 *
 * Atomicity: this resource is wired (in the construct) to depend on the asset
 * `BucketDeployment`s, so the KV flip that activates a new `buildId` happens
 * only AFTER that build's assets are uploaded to S3 — preserving the
 * atomic-deploy cutover guarantee.
 *
 * Bundling: pre-bundled at BUILD time via `scripts/bundle-handlers.mjs`
 * (esbuild → `kv_keys_handler_bundle.mjs`) and shipped through
 * `Code.fromAsset`, NOT bundled at synth via `NodejsFunction`. Reason:
 * `@aws-sdk/client-cloudfront-keyvaluestore` is NOT in the Lambda runtime
 * baseline (it requires SigV4a signing), and a synth-time `NodejsFunction`
 * would resolve `projectRoot`/lockfile under `node_modules/` once this package
 * is installed from npm and fail. See `kv_keys.ts` for the asset wiring.
