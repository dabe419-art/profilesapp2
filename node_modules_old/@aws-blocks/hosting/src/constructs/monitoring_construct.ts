/**
 * Default CloudWatch alarm wiring (P3.1 + P3.2).
 *
 * The previous version of the construct created no alarms. Operators
 * found out about Lambda errors / 5xx spikes / poison-pill DLQ
 * messages from end-user reports — by which point the cause was old
 * enough that recent logs had been retention-rotated away. This
 * construct wires a small, opinionated default set:
 *
 *   - CloudFront 5xx error rate > 5% over 5 min
 *   - SSR Lambda error rate >= 1% of invocations over 5 min
 *     (CloudWatch math expression `errors / invocations * 100`, so the
 *     alarm scales with traffic instead of using an absolute count;
 *     tunable via `ssrErrorRatePercent`)
 *   - SSR Lambda throttles > 0 over 5 min
 *   - SQS DLQ depth >= 1 (any poison message)
 *
 * Alarms are off by default (`enabled: false`) so the construct stays
 * cheap-by-default. When the user opts in we either create an SNS
 * topic and surface its ARN (so the user can subscribe), or attach
 * the user-supplied topic. Cost: pennies/month at idle, scales with
 * alarm-state changes (not requests), plus ~$1/month for the alarm
 * topic's KMS key.
 *
 * The auto-created topic is always encrypted with a dedicated
 * customer-managed KMS key. An AWS-managed key (`alias/aws/sns`)
 * cannot be used: its policy is not editable and does not grant
 * CloudWatch, so every alarm action fails with `KMSAccessDenied` and
 * notifications are dropped silently. See `createAlarmTopicKey`.
 * Callers who need different key management supply their own
 * `snsTopic` (and own its encryption).

/**
 * Create the customer-managed key that encrypts the alarm topic.
 *
 * CloudWatch calls KMS **directly** (not via SNS) when it publishes an
 * alarm notification to an encrypted topic, so the key policy needs an
 * explicit grant for the `cloudwatch.amazonaws.com` service principal.
 * Without it the alarm action fails with `KMSAccessDenied` and the
 * notification is dropped — the alarm still flips to ALARM in the
 * console, so the failure is invisible until someone notices the page
 * that never arrived. Account-root/IAM delegation (the only statement
 * on the default `Key` policy, and the only one some policy injectors
 * add) does NOT cover service principals.
 *
 * `resources: ['*']` is scoped to *this* key — a resource policy can
 * only speak for the resource it is attached to, and this key is
 * single-purpose (the alarm topic is its only user). The
 * `aws:SourceAccount` guard blocks the cross-account confused-deputy
 * case; it is `IfExists` because that key is only populated on direct
 * service-principal calls, and a hard `StringEquals` would
 * reintroduce the exact silent-deny this grant exists to prevent.
