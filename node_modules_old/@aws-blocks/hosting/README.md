# @aws-blocks/hosting

Low-level CDK L3 constructs for deploying web applications on AWS
(CloudFront, S3, Lambda, WAF, monitoring, DNS).

## Overview

This package provides:

1. **`HostingConstruct`** -- a CDK L3 construct that provisions a full hosting
   stack (CloudFront distribution, S3 origin, Lambda compute, optional WAF,
   monitoring dashboards, and DNS records).

2. **Framework adapters** (Next.js, Nuxt, Astro, SPA) that run the framework
   build, produce a `DeployManifest`, and hand off to the construct for
   provisioning.

3. **Manifest types** (`DeployManifest`, `RouteBehavior`, `ComputeResource`,
   etc.) that describe the shape of a deployment.

## When to use this package directly

Most users should use `Hosting` from `@aws-blocks/core`, which wraps these
constructs with the AWS Blocks integration layer (route registry, config.json
generation, RPC prefix wiring).

Use `HostingConstruct` directly when you need:

- A standalone CDK app without the AWS Blocks layer
- Fine-grained control over construct props
- Custom adapters or manifest generation pipelines

## Main exports

```ts
// Root entry point: the CDK-free value API (safe to import in SSR/runtime code)
import { secret, config, getSecret, getConfig } from '@aws-blocks/hosting';

// Sub-path: the construct, manifest types, and the CDK resolution engine
import {
  HostingConstruct,
  HostingConstructProps,
  HostingDomainConfig,
  HostingWafConfig,
  generateBuildId,
  DeployManifest,
  RouteBehavior,
  ComputeResource,
  FrameworkAdapterFn,
  HostingError,
} from '@aws-blocks/hosting/constructs';

// Sub-path: adapters only
import { nextjsAdapter, nuxtAdapter, astroAdapter, spaAdapter } from '@aws-blocks/hosting/adapters';

// Sub-path: typed errors
import { HostingError } from '@aws-blocks/hosting/error';
```

> The value API is on the bare `@aws-blocks/hosting` entry so an SSR/runtime bundle
> can import `getSecret`/`getConfig` without pulling in CDK. The construct and the
> resolution engine live on `/constructs`.

## Secrets & config

Keep sensitive and environment-specific values out of source. You declare a value
by **which function you call** — that choice picks the store, and the framework
owns everything else (the CLI write, the IAM grant, the runtime read):

| Declare (infra) | Store | Read (runtime) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `secret('KEY')` | AWS **Secrets Manager** (sensitive) | `getSecret('KEY')` |
| `config('KEY')` | AWS **SSM Parameter Store** (non-sensitive, free tier) | `getConfig('KEY')` |

### Declare — in your hosting infra

```ts
import { HostingConstruct } from '@aws-blocks/hosting/constructs';
import { secret, config } from '@aws-blocks/hosting';

new HostingConstruct(stack, 'Web', {
  manifest, // produced by a framework adapter (see "Main exports")
  environment: {
    STRIPE_KEY: secret('STRIPE_KEY'), // → Secrets Manager
    FEATURE_FLAGS: config('FEATURE_FLAGS'), // → SSM Parameter Store
  },
  // Optional per-kind namespace / cache config:
  secretStore: { prefix: '/myapp/secrets' },
  configStore: { prefix: '/myapp/config', cacheTtlSeconds: 30 },
});
```

The marker is inert (`{ key, kind }`) and safe to commit — only the store
*locator* is injected (never the value), and the compute role is granted
least-privilege read on that one resource (`secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` /
`ssm:GetParameter`, scoped to the exact ARN) plus `kms:Decrypt`.

Markers in `environment` are wired for **runtime** resolution (above), so both
`secret()` and `config()` are allowed there (only the locator is injected, never
the value). Resolving a marker to a literal at **synth time** — e.g. for
`domain.domainName`, which must be a literal before CloudFront/ACM are built —
**inlines the value into the CloudFormation template**, so those positions accept
only `config()` (non-sensitive → SSM) or a plain string, never `secret()`. Synth
resolution needs an async wrapper that does the SDK read during construction; that
path is provided by the Blocks `Hosting` block (`await Hosting.create(...)`), not
this leaf construct, whose `domain.domainName` is a plain `string | string[]`.

**Bring your own:** `environment` also accepts an existing CDK `ISecret` /
`IParameter` handle — the construct grants read via the handle and injects its
locator, so `getSecret` / `getConfig` resolve it identically (managed
*provisions*, BYO *references*).

### Read — in your SSR / API / runtime code

```ts
// The value API is the bare entry (CDK-free), so no CDK is pulled into the runtime bundle:
import { getSecret, getConfig } from '@aws-blocks/hosting';

const key = await getSecret('STRIPE_KEY'); // Secrets Manager
const flags = await getConfig('FEATURE_FLAGS'); // SSM
```

Each getter reads `process.env.KEY` first, so **local dev needs no AWS** — put
the value in a `.env` file. On a deployed function it fetches + decrypts from its
store and caches per cold start (or per `cacheTtlSeconds`, for rotation without a
redeploy).

### Type-safe keys — autocomplete + typo errors, zero code

By default `getSecret` / `getConfig` accept any `string`. Run `hosting-typegen`
(wire it as `"typegen": "hosting-typegen"` and, ideally, a `"predev"` hook) to make
them **type-safe with no call-site change**:

```bash
npx hosting-typegen           # scan secret()/config() calls → .blocks/hosting-values.d.ts
npx hosting-typegen --watch   # regenerate on every save (run alongside your dev server)
npx hosting-typegen --check   # CI: fail if that file is stale
```

**In a Blocks app you get this for free** — the Blocks dev server (`npm run dev`)
auto-detects `secret()`/`config()` usage and runs the generate-and-watch step itself,
so keys update as you type with no second command. (It's a no-op if the app declares
no secrets, and never blocks the dev server.) For a standalone hosting app, run
`hosting-typegen --watch` alongside your dev server, or add a `"predev"` hook. Either
way, add `hosting-typegen --check` in CI to catch a stale committed file.

It statically scans your `secret('...')` / `config('...')` calls (no app execution,
no AWS credentials) and generates a `.d.ts` that narrows the getters to exactly your
declared keys — so a typo, or reading a `config` key with `getSecret` (the wrong
store), is a **compile error**, and your editor autocompletes the valid keys:

```ts
await getSecret('STRIPE_KEY'); // ✅ declared with secret()
await getSecret('STRIPE_KYE'); // ❌ compile error — not a declared secret key
```

Add the generated file to your `tsconfig.json` `include` and let the tool own it
(it is regenerated, never hand-edited):

```jsonc
{ "include": ["src", "aws-blocks", ".blocks/**/*.d.ts"] }
```

The keys come straight from your `secret()`/`config()` calls — the single source of
truth — so the types can't drift from what you wired. The file is safe to delete
(the keys just fall back to `string`) and safe to `.gitignore` and regenerate.
Because it is derived only from string-literal keys, a `secret(myVar)` with a
non-literal key is reported and skipped; and a synth-only `domain` / `connectionArn`
key may appear in autocomplete even though it is not readable at runtime.

### Typed, parsed values with a schema

Pass a schema (Zod, Valibot, ArkType — any Standard Schema) to get a **typed,
parsed** value instead of a `string`:

```ts
// declare
import { z } from 'zod';
environment: { FEATURE_FLAGS: config('FEATURE_FLAGS', { schema: z.object({ beta: z.boolean() }) }) }

// read — no JSON.parse, no `any`
const { beta } = await getConfig('FEATURE_FLAGS');   // typed as { beta: boolean }
```

`typegen` infers the schema's output type (via a TypeScript `Program`) and inlines
it into the generated `.d.ts`, so `getConfig`/`getSecret` **return that type**. At
runtime the value is JSON-parsed automatically (a per-key flag is set at synth). The
schema type is typed as `StandardSchemaV1`, so the library is your choice. Note this
is parse-to-type: the schema object isn't shipped to the runtime (it can't cross the
synth→runtime bundle boundary), so it parses to the declared type rather than
deep-re-validating on read.

### Transport markers across a JSON / build boundary

A marker is branded with a `Symbol` (and may carry a non-serializable `schema`), so
it does **not** survive a plain `JSON.stringify` → `JSON.parse`: the brand is dropped
and `isManagedValue()` returns `false` on the far side. If you carry a config object
containing markers across a JSON boundary — e.g. an orchestrator that serializes
per-stage config into a build **environment variable** and reads it back in a later
build phase — use the codec for a lossless round-trip:

```ts
import {
  managedValueReplacer,
  managedValueReviver,
  encodeManagedValue,
  decodeManagedValue,
  isManagedValueJSON,
  ManagedValueCodecError,
} from '@aws-blocks/hosting';

// Producer (phase 1): stringify with the replacer, stash in an env var.
process.env.STAGE_CONFIG = JSON.stringify({ domain: config('DOMAIN'), apiKey: secret('API_KEY') }, managedValueReplacer);

// Consumer (phase 2, possibly a different process): parse with the reviver.
const cfg = JSON.parse(process.env.STAGE_CONFIG, managedValueReviver);
isSecret(cfg.apiKey); // true — brand restored
```

`encodeManagedValue` / `decodeManagedValue` are the single-value primitives; the
`managedValueReplacer` / `managedValueReviver` are drop-in `JSON.stringify` /
`JSON.parse` hooks that apply them across a whole (possibly nested) object.

Contract of the wire form (it is a **published, cross-build compatibility boundary**):

- **Versioned.** Every encoded value carries a protocol version
  (`MANAGED_VALUE_JSON_VERSION`). A decoder rejects a version it does not understand
  instead of guessing, so producer and consumer on different package versions fail
  predictably rather than silently misreading each other.
- **Malformed input.** `decodeManagedValue(v: unknown)` validates exhaustively and
  throws a typed `ManagedValueCodecError` on an unsupported version, unknown kind,
  invalid key, or any other malformed shape. The `managedValueReviver`, by contrast,
  **never throws**: anything that is not an exact wire value is left untouched, so a
  stray or future-versioned tagged object passes through as ordinary data.
- **No collisions.** Only an object whose *sole* property is the codec tag is revived
  into a marker. An ordinary object that merely also happens to carry the tag (plus
  other fields) is **not** treated as a wire value, so no sibling data is silently
  dropped.
- **Schema.** A marker's `schema` object is not serializable and is **not**
  transported; what is transported is its operational bit, so the runtime
  **JSON-parse behavior is preserved** across the boundary (a schema-bearing value
  still comes back parsed, not raw). Deep re-validation, however, needs the real
  schema **re-declared on the far side** — the runtime getter is parse-only either
  way (see "Typed, parsed values with a schema" above).

### Set the values (out of band, never in git)

Standalone hosting apps get two bundled CLIs:

```bash
# Secrets Manager — a secret value is NEVER taken from argv (it would land in
# shell history). Omit the value for a hidden prompt, or pipe it via --value-stdin:
npx hosting-secret set STRIPE_KEY --prefix /myapp/secrets --region us-east-1   # hidden prompt
cat key.txt | npx hosting-secret set STRIPE_KEY --value-stdin --prefix /myapp/secrets
npx hosting-secret list --prefix /myapp/secrets
npx hosting-secret remove STRIPE_KEY --prefix /myapp/secrets

# SSM Parameter Store — a config value is non-sensitive, so a positional value is fine:
npx hosting-config set FEATURE_FLAGS '{"beta":true}' --prefix /myapp/config
```

`set` is **create-or-update**: the first call creates the entry, and running it
again overwrites the value in place (no error, no prompt) — that is how you
rotate a value. A **secret** value is never read from `argv` / shell history:
`hosting-secret set` takes it from a **hidden prompt** or `--value-stdin`, and
passing it positionally is a hard error. A **config** value is non-sensitive, so
`hosting-config set KEY value` positionally is allowed (`--value-stdin` / the
prompt still work). `list` prints names only, never values.

`remove` on a **secret** is recoverable by default — the value enters Secrets
Manager's recovery window and can be restored (guards against a typo'd prod key).
Pass `--force` to delete immediately with no recovery. (`config` removes are always
immediate — SSM Parameter Store has no recovery window.)

> **Footguns to know.**
> 1. **Region.** `--region` (or `AWS_REGION`) must match the region the app deploys
>    to, or the deploy reports the value as "not set".
> 2. **Account-global prefix.** The default prefixes (`/hosting/secrets`,
>    `/hosting/config`) are account-global — if more than one app deploys to the
>    same account, give each its own `secretStore.prefix` / `configStore.prefix`
>    (and matching CLI `--prefix`), or their same-named values collide.
> 3. **`stage` is not a security boundary.** An optional `stage` on
>    `secretStore` / `configStore` resolves `<prefix>/<stage>/<key>` and falls
>    back to the shared `<prefix>/<key>`. To make that fallback work the IAM grant
>    is *static*, so a stage's compute has standing read on **both** the stage
>    value and the shared one. Every stage sharing a prefix can read the shared
>    value — put production-only secrets in a stage-scoped slot and keep only a
>    safe cross-stage default (e.g. a sandbox credential) in the shared slot. Two
>    constructs sharing a prefix are not isolated from each other.

## Build retention & rollback

Each deploy uploads its assets under an immutable `builds/<buildId>/` prefix and
flips a CloudFront KeyValueStore pointer (`meta.b`) to the new build. Old builds
are retained for `storage.buildRetentionDays` (default **30**) so you can roll
back, then expired by an S3 lifecycle rule.

- **The build currently being served is never expired**, no matter how long ago
  it was deployed. Only *superseded* builds (ones a later deploy replaced) are
  eligible for cleanup — they are tagged `aws-blocks:build-state=superseded` at
  the cutover, and the lifecycle rule matches only that tag.
- Raise `storage.buildRetentionDays` for a longer rollback window. It must be at
  least `skewProtection.maxAge` (converted to days), or synth throws
  `InvalidSkewProtectionMaxAgeError` — a skew cookie must not outlive the build
  it pins to.
- Optional `storage.deployIntervalDays` is an advisory hint: if you set it and
  it is ≥ `buildRetentionDays`, synth prints a warning that superseded builds
  may expire before your next deploy (shrinking the rollback window). It never
  blocks a deploy and never affects the live build.

> **Cleanup caveat:** a build is tagged superseded only during a normal deploy
> cutover (an `Update` that flips `meta.b`). Builds that become stale outside
> that path — every build already present before upgrading to this version, or
> builds left by an aborted/rolled-back deploy — are never tagged, so the
> lifecycle rule never expires them and they accumulate until you remove them
> manually. This is safe (nothing deletes the live build), just not
> self-cleaning for pre-existing artifacts.

```ts
new HostingConstruct(stack, 'Hosting', {
  manifest,
  storage: {
    buildRetentionDays: 90,   // keep 90 days of rollback targets
    deployIntervalDays: 30,   // advisory only
  },
});
```

## Custom domains

Configure a custom domain through the `domain` prop on `HostingConstruct`
(`HostingDomainConfig`). CloudFront only accepts ACM certificates in
**us-east-1**, so every certificate, whether auto-provisioned or
bring-your-own, must live in us-east-1. There are two paths, depending on where
you manage DNS.

### Route 53 (automatic)

Provide `hostedZone` (the zone domain name) or `hostedZoneId`. The construct
provisions a DNS-validated ACM certificate and creates the A and AAAA alias
records for you. Validation is automatic when the hosted zone is in the same
account as the deployment, because the construct writes the ACM validation
records into the zone itself.

```ts
new HostingConstruct(stack, 'Hosting', {
  manifest,
  domain: {
    domainName: 'app.example.com',
    hostedZone: 'example.com', // a Route 53 zone you control
  },
});
```

Use `hostedZoneId` to skip `HostedZone.fromLookup()`, which otherwise requires
`env: { account, region }` on the stack. This is useful in pipeline stages:

```ts
domain: {
  domainName: 'app.example.com',
  hostedZone: 'example.com',
  hostedZoneId: 'Z0123456789ABCDEFGHIJ',
}
```

### Bring your own DNS (manual)

If you manage DNS elsewhere (your registrar, Cloudflare, or another provider),
omit `hostedZone` and `hostedZoneId` and pass a pre-validated `certificate`, an
ACM certificate in us-east-1. The construct creates no DNS records. Instead it
emits the CloudFront distribution domain as a `DistributionDomainName`
CloudFormation output, so you can point a CNAME at it from your own DNS
provider.

```ts
new HostingConstruct(stack, 'Hosting', {
  manifest,
  domain: {
    domainName: 'app.example.com',
    // no hostedZone: you manage DNS externally
    certificate: myPreValidatedCert, // ACM cert in us-east-1, pre-validated
  },
});
```

### Error behavior

Omitting both `hostedZone` / `hostedZoneId` and `certificate` throws
`MissingCertificateError` at synth time. Synthesis fails immediately, so the
deploy never starts and there is no 72-hour CloudFormation wait on an
unvalidated certificate. A bring-your-own certificate outside us-east-1 fails
synthesis with `InvalidCertificateRegionError`.

### Two-phase workflow for external DNS

A certificate must be validated before CloudFront will serve the domain, and
the CloudFront domain is only known after deploy. Set up external DNS in two
phases around the deploy:

1. **Before deploy:** request an ACM certificate in **us-east-1** for your
   domain and validate it (add the ACM validation CNAME to your DNS, or use
   email validation). Wait until the certificate status is **Issued**.
2. **Deploy:** deploy the stack with `domain: { domainName, certificate }`. The
   stack emits the `DistributionDomainName` output (for example
   `d1234abcd.cloudfront.net`).
3. **After deploy:** in your DNS provider, create a CNAME from your domain
   (`app.example.com`) to the `DistributionDomainName` value. For an apex
   domain, use an ALIAS or ANAME record if your provider supports it.
